												<h2>Basic Rules</h2>
				        </header>
                          <p style="margin-left: 1em;">



1.	You will be given a purse of 1 BILLION to spend from.
                              <br><br>
2.	 We have a total of 420 players present in our player pool from which you can bid and buy your dream 11 . Remember your main goal is to create a squad of 11 players with maximum rating .<br>
Number of players in each position<br>
•	LEFT WING or LEFT MIDFIELDER :  40 <br>
•	RIGHT WING or RIGHT MIDFIELDER : 40<br>
•	STRIKERS or CENTRE FORWARD : 40<br>
•	MIDFIELDERS : 100<br>
•	CENTRE BACKS : 80<br>
•	LEFT BACK : 40<br>
•	RIGHT BACK : 40

<br><br>

3.	Above mentioned are the positions according to which players will be released by us.<br><br>
                              
4.	Players have been distributed slotwise for your convenience.Each slot will be purely dedicated to a particular position only. Each slot will have 20 players in it.For example : IF the first slot of the first day starts with the position of LEFT BACK , then in the first slot , 20 players out of the 40 LEFT BACK players will be present for you to bid on.After the completion of slot 1 ,slot 2 will contain the next 20 players OF THE SAME POSITION (in this case the rest of 20 LEFT BACK players).<br><br>
                              
5.	The slots have been evenly distributed with players of all ratings in all the slots. You can buy a maximum of two players from a slot , but you can bid for all of them.<br><br>
                              
6.	Each day has a total of 3 slots with 20 players in each slot.<br><br>
                              
7.	Each day before the first slot of the day starts , a list of all the 60 players (that are going to be shown on that day) will be released.

<br><br>
8.	The base prices of the players would be according to their ratings (taken from fifaindex.com)<br>
BASE PRICES<br>
95 AND ABOVE : 90 MILLIONS<br>
90 - 94 : 80 MILLIONS<br>
85-89 : 70 MILLIONS<br>
80-84 : 60 MILLIIONS<br>
75-79 : 50 MILLIONS

<br><br>

9.	We strictly instruct you to follow the following formations only<br>
 4-4-2 (4 players in the defence ; 4 players in the midfield ; 2 attackers)<br>
 4-3-3 (4 players in the defence ;3 players in the midfield ; 3 attackers)<br>
 3-4-3 (3 players in the defence ; 4 players in the midfield ; 3 attackers)<br>
 4-2-3-1(open to your ideas,but make sure your team fits the formation)<br>
Note that no particular formation has any points attached to it, these are being given just to make sure that you have options

<br><br>
10.	The card of each player displayed in the auction will display 
<br><br>

•	PLAYER’S NAME<br>
•	PLAYER’S RATING  (taken form fifaindex.com)<br>
•	PLAYER’S PRIMARY PLAYING POSITION (taken form fifaindex.com)
<br><br>

11.	You can bid for all the players in particular slot (regardless of your purse left), but make sure that if you get all the players that you have bid for and that number is exceeding the amount of players a team can have at that position, in such a case, the maximum rated player that you have won in the bidding will be given to you. For example : If you have a purse of 140 MILLION left with you and you bid for all the players that are there in the CENTRE BACK slot 1 . Suppose your bid wins for more than 2 players(WHICH IS THE LIMIT FOR THIS PARTICULAR SLOT(CENTRE BACK)),say 5 players. Then you will be given the top 2 (the upper limit of the SLOT) rated players out of those 5.<br><br>
                              
12.	The cap for each position :<br>
•	LW/LM : 2<br>
•	ST : 2<br>
•	MID : 4<br>
•	CB : 3<br>
•	LB : 2<br>
•	RB : 2<br>
•	GK : 1<br>
NOTE: Apart from these caps we have a cap for the maximum number of buys that you can make in any slot which is of TWO , for all the slots except for the two slots of the goalkeeper position which would have a cap of 1 player that can be bought in each slot.
                              <br><br>
13.	The bidding will be a blind bidding. That means you won't be knowing the highest bid that would presently buy the player, you will have to take a guess so that you can be sure about that player landing into your team. 
                              <br><br>
14.	After each slot is over you will be informed about the players that you have got in that slot and the purse left with your team.
                              <br><br>
15.	Your bid can become invalid in these cases : <br>
•	Your bid is lower than the base price of the player.<br>
•	You have already completed the quota of players for that position in your team.<br>
•	You do not  have the purse left to make the purchase.<br>
•	You have already purchased the number of players you can for that particular slot.(which is two for all slots except Goalkeeper slots (the maximum number of player you can buy for this position is 1).<br>
NOTE : So your bid becomes invalid if you cross the cap that has been set for every position or the cap that has been set for every slot(2 except for the Goalkeeper slot(1)).

<br><br>

16.	 RELEASING A PLAYER<br>
•	We are allowing each team to release one player from each line <br>
   DEFENCE (CB,LB,RB)<br>
   MIDFIELD<br>
   ATTACK (LW,RW,ST)<br>
•	After the results of a particular slot is released ,the  team leader can inform us about the player that you want to release before the next slot starts.<br>
•	No requests for the release will be completed once the next slot starts.<br>
•	YOU WILL ONLY BE GIVEN 90% OF THE MONEY THAT YOU HAD SPENT TO BUY THE PLAYER YOU ARE NOW RELEASING.(90%OF THE COST THAT YOU BID AND NOT 90%OF ITS BASE PRICE)
                              <br><br>
17.	You can also call the players back that are being released or have been unsold. These called players will come into the auction again after all the planned slots (21 st slot) get over. You will be allowed to buy only 3 players from all the players that have been called back.All the players that have been released will be updated to you. A player must be called back so that it can be shown by us for the auction again. A player which is released is not automatically considered in this bracket,one must call this released player back for it to appear on the last day. These players will be released in a single slot and thus, the number of players in this slot may exceed 20.
You can call back any player of any slot ,of any day at any moment of the contest before the final slot for these called back players starts on the final day.Take a note that the base prices for these called back players remains the same even on the final day.

<br><br>

18.	You have to submit your final team’s formation at the end of the auction process.Results of this round will be tabulated according to the team’s overall rating.
                              <br><br>
19.	A total of 8 team would qualify for the next round of the competition, irrespective of the fact whether they complete their squad of 11 players or not.This marking would be done completely on the basis of overall rating if the team

<br><br>

                        <header style="margin-left: 1em;text-decoration: underline;">
												<h2>Position Rules</h2>
				        </header>
                        <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
   
There is a primary position which is specified on each and every player's card.
<br><br>
However, as you know football players can play in more than one position. So we have some rules regarding that.
<br>
If you wish… You can play the players in positions which are different than that given on the card but the ratings will be affected accordingly.
<br><br>
*For your reference, on fifaindex.com, positions in…
<br>
BLUE—ATTACK
<br>
GREEN—MIDFIELD
<br>
YELLOW—DEFENCE
<br>
ORANGE—GOALKEEPER
<br>
Here are the rules—
<br> <br>
1.	If you play a player in any other one of his specified alternate positions, his rating will remain the same. The alternate positions will be considered as per fifaindex.com.
<br>
For example, here in Ronaldo's profile at fifaindex.com, he has 2 positions—ST & LW (with ST being considered as the primary position and LW being considered as the alternate position). So if you play him in any of these two positions, his rating will not change i.e. it will remain 93.

 <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: center;">
                              
										<img src="images/rules_1.png" alt="" class="center"/>
                            </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
                                
2. Now… You may also wish to play him at the RW position. But as RW is not one of his specified alternate positions although it is an attacking position and CR7 is an attacker, so his rating will be reduced by a factor of 2 points only i.e. while calculating the final results we will consider his rating as 91.
<br>
So the bottom-line is that if you play a defender in defence, midfielder in midfield, attacker in attack… But not in one of the player's specified position according to fifaindex.com, the rating will be reduced by a factor of 2.
<br><br>
3.	To determine how a player will be classified as an attacker/midfielder/defender, we will consider the primary position of the player as per fifaindex.com.
<br>
For example, here in Isco's profile at fifaindex.com, he has 3 positions—CAM, CM & LW. Of the three of his given positions two are in midfield (CAM & CM) and one is in attack (LW). But his primary position is CAM which as mentioned above is a midfield position. So, Isco will be considered a midfielder in our auction even though he has an alternate attacking position as well.

  </p>
                          <p style="text-align: center;">
                                    <span>
										<img src="images/rules_2.png" alt="" />
                                    </span>
                            </p>
 <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
<br><br>
4.	Now, if you play him in any position in midfield (like CDM) other than CAM & CM, then   according to Rule 2, his rating will be reduced by a factor of 2. But if you play him at LW, his rating will remain the same as it is one of his specified alternate positions although he is being considered as a midfielder. But if you choose to play him in any other attacking position apart from LW, his rating will be reduced by a factor of 4 since he is a midfielder and you're playing him in attack.
<br>
So in short, the further away you play a player from his playing zone… The higher the deductions.
<br><br>
That is, if you play an attacker in midfield in a position which is not his alternate position, the rating will be reduced by a factor of 4. If you play an attacker in defence the rating will be reduced by a factor of 6!
<br>
Similarly, if you play a midfielder in attack, in a position which is not his alternate position, the rating will be reduced by a factor of 4. And if you play him in defence in a position which is not one of his specified alternate positions, the rating will still be reduced by a factor of 4 only.
<br><br>
5.	You cannot play a goalkeeper as an outfield player and vice-versa. If however, for some reason, you do… We will consider the rating to be ZERO!
<br><br>
We hope the rules regarding position are clear to you. However, in case of any discrepancy or doubt you can contact us.
